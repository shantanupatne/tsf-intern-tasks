## Task 2
Supervised Machine Learning. Creating a simple linear regression model to fit the data. This is done with sklearn as well as without.  
[With](./Task2/Task2_sklearn.ipynb) sklearn  
[Without](./Task2/Task2_algo.ipynb) sklearn

---

## Task 4
Exploring Decision Trees. Creating and visualizing a decision tree classifier using sklearn and matplotlib.

## Task 5
Business Analysis.
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis on a sample Superstore dataset. This is done in RStudio using the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` library.  
Both, static and dynamic plots are created. The static plots are in the markdown. The dynamic plots have been deployed through a Shiny App.  
[Static](./Task5/analysis.md) plots.   
[Dynamic](https://shangkong23.shinyapps.io/interactive/) plots i.e. ShinyApp.
